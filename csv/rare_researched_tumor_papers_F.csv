106,"Personalized chordoma organoids for drug discovery studies; NA; Chordomas are rare tumors of notochordal origin, most commonly arising in the sacrum or skull base. Primary treatment of chordoma is surgery, however complete resection is not always feasible due to their anatomic location, and recurrence rates remain high. Chordomas are considered insensitive to conventional chemotherapy, and their rarity complicates running timely and adequately powered trials to identify effective regimens. Therefore, there is a need for discovery of novel therapeutic approaches. Drug discovery efforts in chordoma have been mostly limited to cell line models. Patient-derived organoids can accelerate drug discovery studies and predict patient responses to therapy. In this proof-of-concept study, we successfully established organoids from seven chordoma tumor samples obtained from five patients presenting with tumors in different sites and stages of disease. The organoids recapitulated features of the original parent tumors and inter-as well as intra-patient heterogeneity. High-throughput screenings performed on the organoids highlighted targeted agents such as PI3K/mTOR, EGFR, and JAK2/STAT3 inhibitors among the most effective molecules. Pathway analysis underscored how the NF-kB and IGF-1R pathways are sensitive to perturbations and potential targets to pursue for combination therapy of chordoma.",spine,spine,,ok
1468,"CD146 increases stemness and aggressiveness in glioblastoma and activates YAP signaling.; Cancer stem cells and EMT and Glioblastoma stem cells and MCAM and YAP and Zebrafish; Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly malignant and lethal brain tumor, is characterized by diffuse invasion into the brain and chemo-radiotherapy resistance resulting in poor prognosis. In this study, we examined the involvement of the cell adhesion molecule CD146/MCAM in regulating GBM aggressiveness. Analyses of GBM transcript expression databases revealed correlations of elevated CD146 levels with higher glioma grades, IDH-wildtype and unmethylated MGMT phenotypes, poor response to chemo-radiotherapy and worse overall survival. In a panel of GBM stem cells (GSCs) variable expression levels of CD146 were detected, which strongly increased upon adherent growth. CD146 was linked with mesenchymal transition since expression increased in TGF--treated U-87MG cells. Ectopic overexpression of CD146/GFP in GG16 cells enhanced the mesenchymal phenotype and resulted in increased cell invasion. Conversely, GSC23-CD146 knockouts had decreased mesenchymal marker expression and reduced cell invasion in transwell and GBM-cortical assembloid assays. Moreover, using GSC23 xenografted zebrafish, we found that CD146 depletion resulted in more compact delineated tumor formation and reduced tumor cell dissemination. Stem cell marker expression and neurosphere formation assays showed that CD146 increased the stem cell potential of GSCs. Furthermore, CD146 mediated radioresistance by stimulating cell survival signaling through suppression of p53 expression and activation of NF-B. Interestingly, CD146 was also identified as an inducer of the oncogenic Yes-associated protein (YAP). In conclusion, CD146 carries out various pro-tumorigenic roles in GBM involving its cell surface receptor function, which include the stimulation of mesenchymal and invasive properties, stemness, and radiotherapy resistance, thus providing an interesting target for therapy.",brain,cortex,,brain
1518,"Uncovering the mode of action of engineered T cells in patient cancer organoids.; NA; Extending the success of cellular immunotherapies against blood cancers to the realm of solid tumors will require improved in vitro models that reveal therapeutic modes of action at the molecular level. Here we describe a system, called BEHAV3D, developed to study the dynamic interactions of immune cells and patient cancer organoids by means of imaging and transcriptomics. We apply BEHAV3D to live-track >150,000engineered Tcells cultured with patient-derived, solid-tumor organoids, identifying a 'super engager' behavioral cluster comprising Tcells with potent serial killing capacity. Among other Tcell concepts we also study cancer metabolome-sensing engineered Tcells (TEGs) and detect behavior-specific gene signatures that include a group of 27genes with no previously described Tcell function that are expressed by super engager killer TEGs. We further show that typeI interferon can prime resistant organoids for TEG-mediated killing. BEHAV3D is a promising tool for the characterization of behavioral-phenotypic heterogeneity of cellular immunotherapies and may support the optimization of personalized solid-tumor-targeting cell therapies.",blood,blood,,unidentified
1561,"Ameloblastoma modifies tumor microenvironment for enhancing invasiveness by altering collagen alignment.; Ameloblastoma and Collagen alignment and Extracellular matrix and Odontogenic keratocyst and RNA sequencing and Tumoroid; Tumor progression is profoundly affected by crosstalk between cancer cells and their stroma. In the past decades, the development of bioinformatics and the establishment of organoid model systems have allowed extensive investigation of the relationship between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the interaction between tumor cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in odontogenic epithelial neoplasms and the ECM remodeling mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, transcriptomic comparison and histopathologic analysis revealed that TME-related genes were upregulated in ameloblastoma compared to in odontogenic keratocysts. Tumoroid analysis indicated that type I collagen is required for ameloblastoma progression. Furthermore, ameloblastoma shows the capacity to remodel the ECM independently of cancer-associated fibroblasts. In conclusion, ameloblastoma-mediated ECM remodeling contributes to the formation of an invasive collagen architecture during tumor progression.",tooth,tooth,,ok
1562,"Anlotinib Combined with Toripalimab as Second-Line Therapy for Advanced, Relapsed Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Carcinoma.; anlotinib and gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma and second-line therapy and toripalimab and tumor microenviroment; Our study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of anlotinib-toripalimab combination therapy as a second-line treatment for advanced relapsed gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma (GC/GEJC). In this single arm, single-center extension clinical trial, patients with advanced relapsed GC/GEJC received toripalimab (240 mg, intravenously over 60 minutes, once every 2 weeks) plus anlotinib (12 mg/day, orally, 2 weeks on and 1 week off, every 3 weeks) as second-line therapy. There were 29 patients who achieved partial response, and the ORR was 32.3% (95% CI, 26.6%-38.5%). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were recorded in 7 participants (11.3%), all of which were manageable. The PFS and OS were 4.0 and 11.1 months, respectively. Patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive expression showed numerically longer OS than the negative ones although the difference was not significantly. The tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) group showed a significantly better OS (P = .05) than the TMB-Low (TMB-L) group. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) mutations positively correlated with target lesion reduction (odds ratio [OR] = 0.14; P = .02). The new regimen increased tumor-infiltration of CD8+ T and CD3+ T cells. Furthermore, a patient-derived organoid (PDO) study indicated that anlotinib could promote an immune-supportive tumor microenvironment. As conclusion, the anlotinib-toripalimab combination showed promising efficacy and favorable safety as a second-line treatment for advanced, relapsed GC/GEJC. The PD-L1 expression, TMB, and FGFR2 mutation are potential biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of this regimen (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04713059).",gastroesophageal junction,gastroesophageal junction,,stomach

Here, we evaluated distribution of MUC5AC and MUC5B in bronchiolar adenoma/ciliated muconodular papillary tumor for comparison with that seen in normal respiratory tract. In normal respiratory tract, MUC5AC was mainly distributed in large bronchi, while MUC5B was distributed in bronchi, bronchioles, and submucosal glands. In bronchiolar adenoma/ciliated muconodular papillary tumor, MUC5AC was primarily distributed in luminal cells of large airspaces, and MUC5B was distributed in luminal cells of small airspaces and mucinous glands, in addition to large airspaces, regardless of distal or proximal differentiation. In particular, MUC5B was distributed in non-mucinous club and ciliated cells in both the normal respiratory tract and bronchiolar adenoma/ciliated muconodular papillary tumor. These results indicate that MUC5AC and MUC5B distribution in bronchiolar adenoma/ciliated muconodular papillary tumor is similar to that seen in normal respiratory tract, suggestive of organoid differentiation simulating the normal lung.  2022 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",bronchiole,bronchiole,,unidentified
1821,"Organoids From Mucinous Appendiceal Adenocarcinomas as High-Fidelity Models for Individual Therapy.; chemotherapy and drug sensitivity test and individualized therapy and mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma and organoid culture; BACKGROUND: Mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma (MAA) is a rare, heterogeneous disease. Patients with unrespectable mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma presenting with peritoneal spread are treated by intraperitoneal chemotherapy, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. However, there are no guidelines for efficacious drugs against mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, relevant high-fidelity models should be investigated to identify effective drugs for individual therapy. METHODS: Surgical tumor specimens were obtained from a mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma patient. The tissue was digested and organoid culture was established. H&E and immunohistochemistry staining as well as DNA sequencing was performed on tissue and organoid. The pathological characteristics and gene mutations of the organoid were compared to those of the original tumor. Drug sensitivity tests were performed on organoid and the patient clinical responds to chemotherapy and targeted therapy was compared. RESULTS: Organoids were successfully established and stably passaged. Pathological characteristics of organoids including H&E staining and expression of protein markers (CK20, CDX-2, STAB2, CD7, PAX8) were consistent to those of the original tumor. Moreover, the organoids carried the same gene mutations as the primary tumor. Sensitivity of the organoids to chemotherapeutic drugs and tyrosine kinase inhibitors included: 5-FU (IC(50) 43.95 M), Oxaliplatin (IC(50) 23.49 M), SN38 (IC(50) 1.02 M), Apatinib (IC(50) 0.10 M), Dasatinib (IC(50) 2.27 M), Docetaxel (IC(50) 5.26 M), Regorafenib (IC(50) 18.90 M), and Everolimus (IC(50) 9.20 M).

1866,"Exploring stem cell biology in pituitary tumors and derived organoids.; cytokines and organoids and pituitary stem cells and pituitary tumors; Pituitary tumorigenesis is highly prevalent and causes major endocrine disorders. Hardly anything is known on the behavior of the local stem cells in this pathology. Here, we explored the stem cells' biology in mouse and human pituitary tumors using transcriptomic, immunophenotyping and organoid approaches. In the prolactinoma-growing pituitary of dopamine receptor D2 knock-out mice, the stem cell population displays an activated state in terms of proliferative activity and distinct cytokine/chemokine phenotype. Organoids derived from the tumorous glands' stem cells recapitulated these aspects of the stem cells' activation nature. Upregulated cytokines, in particular interleukin-6, stimulated the stem cell-derived organoid development and growth process. In human pituitary tumors, cells typified by expression of stemness markers, in particular SOX2 and SOX9, were found present in a wide variety of clinical tumor types, also showing a pronounced proliferative status. Organoids efficiently developed from human tumor samples, displaying a stemness phenotype as well as tumor-specific expression fingerprints. Transcriptomic analysis revealed fading of cytokine pathways at organoid development and passaging, but their reactivation did not prove capable of rescuing early organoid expansion and passageability arrest. Taken together, our study revealed and underscored an activated phenotype of the pituitary-resident stem cells in tumorigenic glands and tumors. Our findings pave the way to defining the functional position of the local stem cells in pituitary tumor pathogenesis, at present barely known. Deeper insight can lead to more efficient and targeted clinical management, currently still not satisfactorily.",pituitary,pituitary,,ok
2027,"Establishment of a patient-derived organoid model and living biobank for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.; 3-dimensional culture and Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and biobank and organoid; BACKGROUND: Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a major challenge for clinicians and scientists. Tumor organoid is a revelational disease model that highly resembled the heterogeneity and histopathological characteristics of original tumors. This study aimed to optimize the modeling process of patient-derived NPC organoids (NPCOs), and establish a living-biobank of NPCs to study the mechanism and explore the more effective treatment of the disease. METHODS: Sixty-two fresh NPC tissue samples and 15 normal mucosa samples were collected for 3-dimensional (3D) organoid culture. The organoids were confirmed using hematoxylin and eosin assays. The expression levels of CD133, CD44, BMI-1, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Recurrent NPCOs were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 6 months and then resuscitated and passaged. RESULTS: We identified a novel two-step enzymatic strategy for the treatment of NPC and nasal mucosa specimens and an optimal medium for culturing NPCOs and nasal mucosa organoids (NMOs). Organoid cultures were generated from 34 primary NPC samples, 28 recurrent NPC samples, and 15 normal mucosa samples. The success rates for primary NPCO, recurrent NPCO, and NMO formation were 47.06%, 81.25%, and 86.5%, respectively. All the NPCOs were EBER positive and CK7 negative. Recurrent NPCOs had higher expressions of stem cell markers, including BMI-1, CD44, and CD133. Additionally, recurrent NPCOs could be cultured to passage 4 and frozen and revived repeatedly, while primary NPCOs were challenging to culture. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we successfully established a living biobank using the NPCO model, which has enormous potential in basic and clinical research on NPC.",nasopharynx,nasopharynx,nasal,ok

2904,"Patient-derived organoids for personalized gallbladder cancer modelling and drug screening.; HDAC and drug screening and gallbladder cancer and organoids; BACKGROUND: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a relatively rare but highly aggressive cancer with late clinical detection and a poor prognosis. However, the lack of models with features consistent with human gallbladder tumours has hindered progress in pathogenic mechanisms and therapies. METHODS: We established organoid lines derived from human GBC as well as normal gallbladder and benign gallbladder adenoma (GBA) tissues. The histopathology signatures of organoid cultures were identified by H&E staining, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The genetic and transcriptional features of organoids were analysed by whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing. A set of compounds targeting the most active signalling pathways in GBCs were screened for their ability to suppress GBC organoids. The antitumour effects of candidate compounds, CUDC-101 and CUDC-907, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The established organoids were cultured stably for more than 6 months and closely recapitulated the histopathology, genetic and transcriptional features, and intratumour heterogeneity of the primary tissues at the single-cell level. Notably, expression profiling analysis of the organoids revealed a set of genes that varied across the three subtypes and thus may participate in the malignant progression of gallbladder diseases. More importantly, we found that the dual PI3K/HDAC inhibitor CUDC-907 significantly restrained the growth of various GBC organoids with minimal toxicity to normal gallbladder organoids.

3206,"Paneth cell-derived growth factors support tumorigenesis in the small intestine.; NA; Paneth cells (PCs) are small intestinal epithelial cells that secrete antimicrobial peptides and growth factors, such as Wnt ligands. Intriguingly, the context in which PC-derived Wnt secretion is relevant in vivo remains unknown as intestinal epithelial ablation of Wnt does not affect homeostatic proliferation or restitution after irradiation injury. Considering the importance of growth factors in tumor development, we explored here the role of PCs in intestinal carcinogenesis using a genetic model of PC depletion through conditional expression of diphtheria toxin- subunit. PC depletion in Apc (Min) mice impaired adenoma development in the small intestine and led to decreased Wnt3 expression in small bowel adenomas. To determine if PC-derived Wnt3 was required for adenoma development, we examined tumor formation after PC-specific ablation of Wnt3 We found that this was sufficient to decrease small intestinal adenoma formation; moreover, organoids derived from these tumors displayed slower growth capacity. Overall, we report that PC-derived Wnt3 is required to sustain early tumorigenesis in the small bowel and identify a clear role for PC-derived Wnt production in intestinal pathology.",small intestine,small intestine,,ok
3207,"The chromatin landscape of primary synovial sarcoma organoids is linked to specific epigenetic mechanisms and dependencies.; NA; Synovial sarcoma (SyS) is an aggressive mesenchymal malignancy invariably associated with the chromosomal translocation t(X:18; p11:q11), which results in the in-frame fusion of the BAF complex gene SS18 to one of three SSX genes. Fusion of SS18 to SSX generates an aberrant transcriptional regulator, which, in permissive cells, drives tumor development by initiating major chromatin remodeling events that disrupt the balance between BAF-mediated gene activation and polycomb-dependent repression. Here, we developed SyS organoids and performed genome-wide epigenomic profiling of these models and mesenchymal precursors to define SyS-specific chromatin remodeling mechanisms and dependencies. We show that SS18-SSX induces broad BAF domains at its binding sites, which oppose polycomb repressor complex (PRC) 2 activity, while facilitating recruitment of a non-canonical (nc)PRC1 variant. Along with the uncoupling of polycomb complexes, we observed H3K27me3 eviction, H2AK119ub deposition and the establishment of de novo active regulatory elements that drive SyS identity. These alterations are completely reversible upon SS18-SSX depletion and are associated with vulnerability to USP7 loss, a core member of ncPRC1.1. Using the power of primary tumor organoids, our work helps define the mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation on which SyS cells are dependent.",synovial joint,synovial joint,,ok
3419,"Ezh2 inhibition as new epigenetic treatment option for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (Pannens); NA; Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are epigenetically driven tumors, but therapies against underlying epigenetic drivers are currently not available in the clinical practice. We aimed to investigate EZH2 (Enhancer of Zest homolog) expression in PanNEN and the impact of EZH2 inhibition in three different PanNEN preclinical models. EZH2 expression in PanNEN patient samples (n = 172) was assessed by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinico-pathological data. Viability of PanNEN cell lines treated with EZH2 inhibitor (GSK126) was determined in vitro. Lentiviral transduction of shRNA targeting EZH2 was performed in QGP1 cells, and cell proliferation was measured. Rip1TAG2 mice underwent GSK126 treatment for three weeks starting from week 10 of age. Primary cells isolated from PanNEN patients (n = 6) were cultivated in 3D as islet-like tumoroids and monitored for 10 consecutive days upon GSK126 treatment. Viability was measured continuously for the whole duration of the treatment. We found that high EZH2 expression correlated with higher tumor grade (p < 0.001), presence of distant metastases (p < 0.001), and shorter disease-free survival (p < 0.001) in PanNEN patients. Inhibition of EZH2 in vitro in PanNEN cell lines and in patient-derived islet-like tumoroids reduced cell viability and impaired cell proliferation, while inhibition of EZH2 in vivo in Rip1TAG2 mice reduced tumor burden. Our results show that EZH2 is highly expressed in high-grade PanNENs, and during disease progression it may contribute to aberrations in the epigenetic cellular landscape. Targeting EZH2 may represent a valuable epigenetic treatment option for patients with PanNEN.",islet,islet,,ok

The goal of this study was to preclinically explore the application of immunotherapy in treating appendiceal cancer in a personalized organoid model. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patient tumor organoids (PTO) were fabricated using unsorted tumor cells with and without enrichment with patient-matched immune components derived from peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, or lymph nodes [immune-enhanced PTOs (iPTO)]. Organoids were cultured for 7 days, followed by treatment with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab), and assessed for treatment efficacy. RESULTS: Between September 2019 and May 2021, 26 patients were enrolled in the study.

3599,"Extracorporeal Shock Wave Enhances the Cisplatin Efficacy by Improving Tissue Infiltration and Cellular Uptake in an Upper Urinary Tract Cancer Animal and Human-Derived Organoid Model.; chemotherapy and patient-derived organoid and shock wave and upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma; Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a relatively rare cancer with a poor prognosis if diagnosed at an advanced stage. Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a common treatment strategy, it has a limited response rate. Shock wave lithotripsy is a common treatment for upper urinary tract stones. Low-energy shock waves (LESWs) temporarily increase tissue permeability and enhance drug penetration to the targeted tissue. However, no study has investigated the efficacy of the combination of shock wave lithotripsy and chemotherapy in UTUC. Hence, in this study, we aimed to identify the potential application of the combination of LESW and chemotherapy in UTUC. We evaluated the synergistic effects of LESW and cisplatin in vitro, in vivo, and in patient-derived organoid (PDO) models. Compared with cisplatin alone, the combination treatment caused more significant tumour suppression in vitro and in animal models, without increased toxicity. Histological examination showed that compared with animals treated with cisplatin alone, those who received the combination treatment showed more deteriorated cell arrangement and cell oedema. Moreover, LESW improved the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in the preclinical PDO model of UTUC. Thus, LESW combined with cisplatin is a potential new antitumour strategy for improving the treatment response in locally advanced UTUC.",urinary,urinary,,ok

Lack of disease-specific in-vitro models of NPC, together with difficulties in establishing patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, have further hindered development of personalized therapeutic options. Herein, we established two NPC organoid lines from recurrent NPC PDX models and further characterized and compared these models with original patient tumors using RNA sequencing analysis. Organoids were cultured in hypoxic conditions to examine the effects of hypoxia and radioresistance. These models were then utilized to determine the radiobiological parameters, such as alpha/beta ratio and oxygen enhancement ratio (OER), characteristic to radiosensitive normoxic and radioresistant hypoxic NPC, using simple dose-survival data analytic tools. The results were further validated in-vitro and in-vivo, to determine the optimal boost dose and fractionation regimen required to achieve effective NPC tumor regression. Despite the differences in tumor microenvironment due to the lack of human stroma, RNA sequencing analysis revealed good correlation of NPC PDX and organoid models with patient tumors. Additionally, the established models also mimicked inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Hypoxic NPC organoids were highly radioresistant and had high alpha/beta ratio compared to its normoxic counterparts. In-vitro and in-vivo fractionation studies showed that hypoxic NPC was less sensitive to RT fractionation scheme and required a large bolus dose or 1.4 times of the fractionated dose that was effective against normoxic cells in order to compensate for oxygen deficiency.

While novel treatment options are being developed, patient stratification permitting more personalized treatment selection in PanNET is yet not feasible since no predictive markers are established. The lack of representative in vitro and in vivo models as well as the rarity and heterogeneity of PanNET are prevailing reasons for this. In this study, we describe an in vitro 3-dimensional (3-D) human primary PanNET culture system as a novel preclinical model for more personalized therapy selection. We present a screening platform allowing multicenter sample collection and drug screening in 3-D cultures of human primary PanNET cells. We demonstrate that primary cells isolated from PanNET patients and cultured in vitro form islet-like tumoroids. Islet-like tumoroids retain a neuroendocrine phenotype and are viable for at least 2 weeks in culture with a high success rate (86%). Viability can be monitored continuously allowing for a per-well normalization. In a proof-of-concept study, islet-like tumoroids were screened with three clinically approved therapies for PanNET: sunitinib, everolimus and temozolomide.

We have developed a cancerous model of Rb in retinal organoids derived from genetically engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with a biallelic mutagenesis of the RB1 gene. These organoid Rbs exhibit properties highly consistent with Rb tumorigenesis, transcriptome, and genome-wide methylation. Single-cell sequencing analysis suggests that Rb originated from ARR3-positive maturing cone precursors during development, which was further validated by immunostaining. Notably, we found that the PI3K-Akt pathway was aberrantly deregulated and its activator spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) was significantly up-regulated. In addition, SYK inhibitors led to remarkable cell apoptosis in cancerous organoids. In conclusion, we have established an organoid Rb model derived from genetically engineered hESCs in a dish that has enabled us to trace the cell of origin and to test novel candidate therapeutic agents for human Rb, shedding light on the development and therapeutics of other malignancies.",retina,retina,,ok

Method(s): To characterize human corticotroph tumors at the cellular level, we employed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study 4 surgically resected tumors. We also used microarrays to compare individualized paired consecutive culture passages to understand transcriptional shifts as in vitro cultures lost ACTH secretion. Based on these findings, we then modified our in vitro culture methods to develop sustained ACTH-secreting human corticotroph tumoroid cultures. Finding(s): scRNA-seq identified 4 major cell populations, namely corticotroph tumor (73.6%), stromal (11.2%), progenitor (8.3%), and immune cells (6.8%). Microarray analysis revealed striking changes in extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and motility-related genes concordant with loss of ACTH secretion during conventional 2D culture. Based on these findings, we subsequently defined a series of crucial culture nutrients and scaffold modifications that provided a more favorable trophic and structural environment that could maintain ACTH secretion in in vitro human corticotroph tumor cultures for up to 4 months. Interpretation(s): Our human corticotroph tumoroid model is a significant advance in the field of pituitary tumors and will further enable translational research studies to identify critically needed therapies for CD.

4335,"EpCAM(+)CD73(+) mark epithelial progenitor cells in postnatal human lung and are associated with pathogenesis of pulmonary disease including lung adenocarcinoma.; CD73 and EpCAM and adenocarcinoma and congenital lung lesions and immune checkpoint and organoids; Lung injury in mice induces mobilization of discrete subsets of epithelial progenitor cells to promote new airway and alveolar structures. However, whether similar cell types exist in human lung remains unresolved. Using flow cytometry, we identified a distinct cluster of cells expressing the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a cell surface marker expressed on epithelial progenitor cells, enriched in the ecto-5'-nucleotidase CD73 in unaffected postnatal human lungs resected from pediatric patients with congenital lung lesions. Within the EpCAM(+)CD73(+) population, a small subset coexpresses integrin 4 and HTII-280. This population remained stable with age. Spatially, EpCAM(+)CD73(+) cells were positioned along the basal membrane of respiratory epithelium and alveolus next to CD73(+) cells lacking EpCAM. Expanded EpCAM(+)CD73(+) cells give rise to a pseudostratified epithelium in a two-dimensional air-liquid interface or a clonal three-dimensional organoid assay. Organoids generated under alveolar differentiation conditions were cystic-like and lacked robust alveolar mature cell types. Compared with unaffected postnatal lung, congenital lung lesions were marked by clusters of EpCAM(+)CD73(+) cells in airway and cystic distal lung structures lined by simple epithelium composed of EpCAM(+)SCGB1A1(+) cells and hyperplastic EpCAM(+)proSPC(+) cells. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there was a marked increase in EpCAM(+)CD73(+) tumor cells enriched in inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules CD47 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which was associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In conclusion, EpCAM(+)CD73(+) cells are rare novel epithelial progenitor cells in the human lung. Importantly, reemergence of CD73 in lung adenocarcinoma enriched in negative immune checkpoint molecules may serve as a novel therapeutic target.",lung,alveolus,,unidentified
4391,"Modulation of glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I in gastric cancer-derived organoids disrupts homeostatic epithelial cell turnover.; apoptosis and cancer biology and epithelial cell and gastric cancer and glycosylation and sialic acid and stem cells and stem cells-26-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal-I) and -galactoside 2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1); Programmed cell death promotes homeostatic cell turnover in the epithelium but is dysregulated in cancer. The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I is known to block homeostatic apoptosis through 2,6-linked sialylation of the death receptor TNFR1 in many cell types. However, its role has not been investigated in gastric epithelial cells or gastric tumorigenesis. We determined that human gastric antral epithelium rarely expressed ST6Gal-I, but the number of ST6Gal-I-expressing epithelial cells increased significantly with advancing premalignancy leading to cancer. The mRNA expression levels of ST6GAL-I and SOX9 in human gastric epithelial cells correlated positively with one another through the premalignancy cascade, indicating that increased epithelial cell expression of ST6Gal-I is associated with premalignant progression. To determine the functional impact of increased ST6Gal-I, we generated human gastric antral organoids from epithelial stem cells and differentiated epithelial monolayers from gastric organoids. Gastric epithelial stem cells strongly expressed ST6Gal-I, suggesting a novel biomarker of stemness. In contrast, organoid-derived epithelial monolayers expressed markedly reduced ST6Gal-I and underwent TNF-induced, caspase-mediated apoptosis, consistent with homeostasis. Conversely, epithelial monolayers generated from gastric cancer stem cells retained high levels of ST6Gal-I and resisted TNF-induced apoptosis, supporting prolonged survival. Protection from TNF-induced apoptosis depended on ST6Gal-I overexpression, because forced ST6Gal-I overexpression in normal gastric stem cell-differentiated monolayers inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis, and cleavage of 2,6-linked sialic acids from gastric cancer organoid-derived monolayers restored susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis. These findings implicate up-regulated ST6Gal-I expression in blocking homeostatic epithelial cell apoptosis in gastric cancer pathogenesis, suggesting a mechanism for prolonged epithelioid tumor cell survival.",stomach,gastric antrum,,ok
4476,"YAP1-NUTM1 Gene Fusion in Porocarcinoma of the External Auditory Canal.; Auditory canal and Ear and Head and neck and Midline carcinoma and NUT carcinoma and NUTM1 and YAP1; Gene fusions involving the NUTM1 gene (NUT) represent defining genetic markers of a highly aggressive carcinoma type with predilection for the midline structures of children and young adults, hence the original description as NUT midline carcinoma. Recent studies have increasingly documented involvement of the NUTM1 gene in the pathogenesis of other entities as well. We herein describe two cases of auditory canal carcinomas with features of porocarcinoma, both harboring a newly described YAP1-NUTM1 gene fusion. Patients were males aged 28 and 82 years who presented with slowly growing lesions in the external auditory canal. Histologic examination showed monomorphic basaloid and squamoid cells arranged into organoid solid aggregates, nests, ducts, small cysts, and focal pseudocribriform pattern with variable mitotic activity, infiltrative growth, and focal squamous differentiation, particularly in the most superficial part of the tumor. Immunohistochemistry revealed consistent reactivity for CK5, p63 and SOX10 and diffuse aberrant expression of TP53. CK7 expression was limited to a few luminal ductal cells. The androgen receptor and S100 were negative. Next generation sequencing (TruSight RNA fusion panel, Illumina) revealed the same YAP1-NUTM1 gene fusion in both tumors, which was subsequently confirmed by NUT-FISH and the monoclonal anti-NUT antibody. These cases represent a novel contribution to the spectrum of NUT-rearranged head and neck malignancies.

4661,"Neuroendocrine Carcinomas of the Gallbladder: A Clinicopathologic and Immunohistochemical Analysis of 34 Resected Cases; gallbladder;  neuroendocrine carcinoma;  postoperative adjuvant therapy;  prognosis;  Rb1; Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is an aggressive malignant tumor that rarely arises from the gallbladder. Here, we investigated the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of 34 NECs of the gallbladder. The patients were predominantly women (68%) with a median age of 63 years (range, 37 to 82 y). NECs frequently occurred in the fundus (44%) as mass-forming lesions (66%). Histologically, 17 tumors were of small cell type, and another 17 were of large cell type. Twenty-three cases (68%) were associated with biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (38%) and intracholecystic papillary neoplasm (29%). The majority of tumors exhibited a diffuse growth pattern (74%), followed by organoid (24%) or scirrhous (2%) growth patterns. Histologic features related to neuroendocrine differentiation, such as nuclear molding (56%), perilobular pseudopalisading (18%), and rosette formation (15%), were identified. Immunohistochemically, cytokeratin 7 and 20 were expressed in 19 (56%) and 8 (24%) cases, respectively. Loss of Rb1 expression and concomitant overexpression of p16 were observed in 25 (74%) cases. No BRAFV600Emutations were identified in any of the 34 NECs. For survival analysis, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 64%, 35%, and 19%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy was identified as the only independent prognostic factor associated with the overall survival rate. The 1-and 3-year overall survival rates of patients with NECs were poorer for patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder (P&lt;0.001). The complete resection and application of postoperative adjuvant therapy may influence a better clinical outcome in patients with NEC of the gallbladder.  2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

4778,"MSIsensor-pro: Fast, Accurate, and Matched-normal-sample-free Detection of Microsatellite Instability.; Microsatellite and Microsatellite instability and Multinomial distribution and Polymerase slippage and Tumor; Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a key biomarker for cancer therapy and prognosis. Traditional experimental assays are laborious and time-consuming, and next-generation sequencing-based computational methods do not work on leukemia samples, paraffin-embedded samples, or patient-derived xenografts/organoids, due to the requirement of matched normal samples. Herein, we developed MSIsensor-pro, an open-source single sample MSI scoring method for research and clinical applications. MSIsensor-pro introduces a multinomial distribution model to quantify polymerase slippages for each tumor sample and a discriminative site selection method to enable MSI detection without matched normal samples. We demonstrate that MSIsensor-pro is an ultrafast, accurate, and robust MSI calling method. Using samples with various sequencing depths and tumor purities, MSIsensor-pro significantly outperformed the current leading methods in both accuracy and computational cost.

5011,"LGR5(+) epithelial tumor stem-like cells generate a 3D-organoid model for ameloblastoma.; NA; Ameloblastoma (AM) is a benign but locally aggressive tumor with high recurrences. Currently, underlying pathophysiology remains elusive, and radical surgery remains the most definitive treatment with severe morbidities. We have recently reported that AM harbors a subpopulation of tumor epithelial stem-like cells (AM-EpiSCs). Herein, we explored whether LGR5(+) epithelial cells in AM possess stem-like cell properties and their potential contribution to pathogenesis and recurrence of AM. We found that LGR5 and stem cell-related genes were co-expressed in a subpopulation of AM epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro, which were enriched under 3D-spheroid culture. As compared to LGR5(-) counterparts, LGR5(+) AM epithelial cells showed increased expression of various EMT- and stemness-related genes, and functionally, exhibited increased capacity to form 3D-spheroids and generate human tumor 3D organoids, which recapitulated the histopathologic features of distinct subtypes of solid AM, thus, contributing a useful human tumor platform for targeted therapeutic screening. Treatment with a selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitor, vemurafenib, unexpectedly enriched the subpopulation of LGR5(+) AM-EpiSCs in tumor 3D organoids, which may have explained therapeutic resistances and recurrences. These findings suggest that LGR5(+) AM-EpiSCs play a pivotal role in pathogenesis and progression of AM and targeted inhibition of both BRAF and LGR5 potentially serves a novel nonsurgical adjuvant therapeutic approach for this aggressively benign jaw tumor.",tooth,tooth,,ok
5038,"Model of Patient-Specific Immune-Enhanced Organoids for Immunotherapy Screening: Feasibility Study.; NA; INTRODUCTION: We hypothesized that engineering a combined lymph node/melanoma organoid from the same patient would allow tumor, stroma, and immune system to remain viable for personalized immunotherapy screening. METHODS: Surgically obtained matched melanoma and lymph node biospecimens from the same patient were transferred to the laboratory and washed with saline, antibiotic, and red blood cell lysis buffer. Biospecimens were dissociated, incorporated into an extracellular matrix (ECM)-based hydrogel system, and biofabricated into three dimensional (3D) mixed melanoma/node organoids. Cells were not sorted, so as to preserve tumor heterogeneity, including stroma and immune cell components, resulting in immune-enhanced patient tumor organoids (iPTOs). Organoid sets were screened in parallel with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and dabrafenib/trametinib for 72 h. LIVE/DEAD staining and quantitative metabolism assays recorded relative drug efficacy. Histology and immunohistochemistry were used to compare tumor melanoma cells with organoid melanoma cells. Lastly, node-enhanced iPTOs were employed to activate patient-matched peripheral blood T cells for killing of tumor cells in nave PTOs. RESULTS: Ten biospecimen sets obtained from eight stage III and IV melanoma patients were reconstructed as symbiotic immune/tumor organoids between September 2017 and June 2018. Successful establishment of viable organoid sets was 90% (9/10), although organoid yield varied with biospecimen size. Average time from organoid development to initiation of immunotherapy testing was 7 days. In three patients for whom a node was not available, it was substituted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. iPTO response to immunotherapy was similar to specimen clinical response in 85% (6/7) patients. In an additional pilot study, peripheral T cells were circulated through iPTOs, and subsequently transferred to nave PTOs from the same patient, resulting in tumor killing, suggesting a possible role of iPTOs in generating adaptive immunity.

5099,"Hippo-YAP1 Is a Prognosis Marker and Potentially Targetable Pathway in Advanced Gallbladder Cancer.; Gallbladder cancer and Hippo pathway and Verteporfin and YAP1 and molecular-targeted therapies and patient-derived organoids.; Gallbladder cancer is an aggressive disease with late diagnosis and no efficacious treatment. The Hippo-Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling pathway has emerged as a target for the development of new therapeutic interventions in cancers. However, the role of the Hippo-targeted therapy has not been addressed in advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC). This study aimed to evaluate the expression of the major Hippo pathway components mammalian Ste20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1), YAP1 and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and examined the effects of Verteporfin (VP), a small molecular inhibitor of YAP1-TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) protein interaction, in metastatic GBC cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that advanced GBC patients had high nuclear expression of YAP1. High nuclear expression of YAP1 was associated with poor survival in GBC patients with subserosal invasion (pT2). Additionally, advanced GBC cases showed reduced expression of MST1 compared to chronic cholecystitis. Both VP treatment and YAP1 siRNA inhibited the migration ability in GBC cell lines. Interestingly, gemcitabine resistant PDOs with high nuclear expression of YAP1 were sensitive to VP treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that key components of the Hippo-YAP1 signaling pathway are dysregulated in advanced gallbladder cancer and reveal that the inhibition YAP1 may be a candidate for targeted therapy.",gallbladder,gallbladder,,ok
5133,"Development and radiation response assessment in a novel syngeneic mouse model of tongue cancer: 2D culture, 3D organoids and orthotopic allografts; NA; Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are aggressive cancers that contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Although numerous human xenograft models of OSCC have been developed, only a few syngeneic models of OSCC exist. Here, we report on a novel murine model of OSCC, RP-MOC1, derived from a tongue tumor in a C57Bl/6 mouse exposed to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. Phenotypic characterization and credentialing (STR profiling, exome sequencing) of RP-MOC1 cells was performed in vitro. Radiosensitivity was evaluated in 2D culture, 3D organoids, and in vivo using orthotopic allografts. RP-MOC1 cells exhibited a stable epithelial phenotype with proliferative, migratory and invasive properties. Exome sequencing identified several mutations commonly found in OSCC patients. The LD50 for RP-MOC1 cells in 2D culture and 3D organoids was found to be 2.4 Gy and 12.6 Gy, respectively. Orthotopic RP-MOC1 tumors were pan-cytokeratin+ and Ki-67+. Magnetic resonance imaging of orthotopic RP-MOC1 tumors established in immunocompetent mice revealed marked growth inhibition following 10 Gy and 15 Gy fractionated radiation regimens. This radiation response was completely abolished in tumors established in immunodeficient mice. This novel syngeneic model of OSCC can serve as a valuable platform for the evaluation of combination strategies to enhance radiation response against this deadly disease.",tongue,tongue,,ok

METHODS: We generated 3D organoids from paired biopsies representing tumors and adjacent normal mucosa from therapy-nave patients and cell lines. We evaluated growth and structures of 3D organoids treated with 5-fluorouracil ex vivo.

5629,"Three-Dimensional Organoids Reveal Therapy Resistance of Esophageal and Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.; NA; BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oropharyngeal and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, especially the latter, are a lethal disease, featuring intratumoral cancer cell heterogeneity and therapy resistance. To facilitate cancer therapy in personalized medicine, three-dimensional (3D) organoids may be useful for functional characterization of cancer cells ex vivo. We investigated the feasibility and the utility of patient-derived 3D organoids of esophageal and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. METHODS: We generated 3D organoids from paired biopsies representing tumors and adjacent normal mucosa from therapy-nave patients and cell lines. We evaluated growth and structures of 3D organoids treated with 5-fluorouracil ex vivo. RESULTS: Tumor-derived 3D organoids were grown successfully from 15 out of 21 patients (71.4%) and passaged with recapitulation of the histopathology of the original tumors. Successful formation of tumor-derived 3D organoids was associated significantly with poor response to presurgical neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy in informative patients (P = 0.0357, progressive and stable diseases, n = 10 vs. partial response, n = 6). The 3D organoid formation capability and 5-fluorouracil resistance were accounted for by cancer cells with high CD44 expression and autophagy, respectively. Such cancer cells were found to be enriched in patient-derived 3D organoids surviving 5-fluorouracil treatment.

PD-L1 expression in 24 surgical chordoma specimen was determined immunohistochemically with antibodies 28-8 and E1L3N. The ability of patient-derived organoids to detect treatment effects of nivolumab was explored by quantitative and qualitative immunofluorescence and FACS analysis. The more sensitive antibody, E1L3N (ROC=0.896, p=0.001), was associated with greater tumour diameters (p=0.014) and detected both tumour cells and infiltrating lymphocytes in 54% of patients, but only 1-15% of their cells. Organoids generated from PD-L1-positive patients contained both tumour cells and PD-1/CD8-positive lymphocytes and responded to nivolumab treatment with marked dose-dependent diameter reductions of up to 50% and increased cell death in both PD-L1-positive and negative organoids.

METHODS: Appendiceal cancer specimens obtained during cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy procedures (CRS/HIPEC) were dissociated and incorporated into an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel system as three-dimensional (3D), patient-specific tumor organoids. Cells were not sorted, preserving tumor heterogeneity, including stroma and immune cell components. Following establishment of organoid sets, chemotherapy drugs were screened in parallel. Live/dead staining and quantitative metabolism assays recorded which chemotherapies were most effective in killing cancer cells for a specific patient. Maintenance of cancer phenotypes were confirmed by using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Biospecimens from 12 patients were applied for organoid development between November 2016 and May 2018. Successful establishment rate of viable organoid sets was 75% (9/12). Average time from organoid development to chemotherapy testing was 7 days. These tumors included three high-grade appendiceal (HGA) and nine low-grade appendiceal (LGA) primaries obtained from sites of peritoneal metastasis. All tumor organoids were tested with chemotherapeutic agents exhibited responses that were either similar to the patient response or within the variability of the expected clinical response. More specifically, HGA tumor organoids derived from different patients demonstrated variable chemotherapy tumor-killing responses, whereas LGA organoids tested with the same regimens showed no response to chemotherapy.

6120,"A three-dimensional organoid model recapitulates tumorigenic aspects and drug responses of advanced human retinoblastoma.; NA; Persistent or recurrent retinoblastoma (RB) is associated with the presence of vitreous or/and subretinal seeds in advanced RB and represents a major cause of therapeutic failure. This necessitates the development of novel therapies and thus requires a model of advanced RB for testing candidate therapeutics. To this aim, we established and characterized a three-dimensional, self-organizing organoid model derived from chemotherapy-nave tumors. The responses of organoids to drugs were determined and compared to relate organoid model to advanced RB, in terms of drug sensitivities. We found that organoids had histological features resembling retinal tumors and seeds and retained DNA copy-number alterations as well as gene and protein expression of the parental tissue. Cone signal circuitry (M/L(+) cells) and glial tumor microenvironment (GFAP(+) cells) were primarily present in organoids. Topotecan alone or the combined drug regimen of topotecan and melphalan effectively targeted proliferative tumor cones (RXR(+) Ki67(+)) in organoids after 24-h drug exposure, blocking mitotic entry. In contrast, methotrexate showed the least efficacy against tumor cells. The drug responses of organoids were consistent with those of tumor cells in advanced disease.

6436,"Sebaceous Neoplasms with Rippled, Labyrinthine/Sinusoidal, Petaloid, and Carcinoid-Like Patterns: A Study of 57 Cases Validating Their Occurrence as a Morphological Spectrum and Showing No Significant Association with Muir-Torre Syndrome or DNA Mismatch Repair Protein Deficiency; adnexal neoplasm;  mismatch repair protein;  Muir-Torre syndrome;  ripple pattern;  sebaceoma; Sebaceous neoplasms with an organoid pattern (rippled, labyrinthine/sinusoidal, carcinoid-like, and petaloid) are rare. Previous studies suggested that the above patterns likely represent variations along a morphological continuum. The objectives of this study were to (1) validate this proposition by studying a large number of cases, (2) determine whether there are specific associations with clinical features, (3) establish their frequency, and (4) determine whether they have any association with Muir-Torre syndrome. Fifty-seven sebaceous neoplasms (54 sebaceomas and 3 sebaceous carcinomas) with organoid growth patterns were studied. These occurred in 36 men and 18 women (sex unknown in 3), with ages at diagnosis ranging from 22 to 89 years (mean, 63 years). All patients presented with a solitary nodule (mean size, 11 mm) on the head and neck area. Of the 57 tumors, 24 manifested a single growth pattern, 23 had a combination of 2 patterns, and 10 a combination of 3 patterns, indicating that these patterns are part of a morphological continuum of changes. The carcinoid-like pattern was the most frequent in the ""monopatterned"" neoplasms (13 cases), whereas the labyrinthine/sinusoidal pattern comprised most of the ""polypatterned"" lesions, in which various combinations occurred. Immunohistochemically, mismatch repair protein deficiency was detected in 3 of the 22 cases studied, whereas 5 of the 33 patients with available follow-up had an internal malignancy/premalignancy. In conclusion, sebaceous neoplasms with organoid growth patterns are predominantly sebaceomas having a predilection for the scalp, occurring as solitary lesions in elderly patients (male to female ratio of 2:1). Such patterns are expected to be found in a quarter of sebaceomas. In most cases, more than one of the organoid patterns is present. These lesions do not appear to be associated with internal malignancy or mismatch repair deficiency in most cases. However, confirmation of the absence of any significant association with Muir-Torre syndrome syndrome will require genetic studies.  2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The activated B-cell-like DLBCL subtype accounts for roughly one-third of all the cases and has an inferior prognosis. There is a need to develop better class of therapeutics that could target molecular pathways in resistant DLBCLs; however, this requires DLBCLs to be studied in representative tumor microenvironments. The pathogenesis and progression of lymphoma has been mostly studied from the point of view of genetic alterations and intracellular pathway dysregulation. By comparison, the importance of lymphoma microenvironment in which these malignant cells arise and reside has not been studied in as much detail. We have recently elucidated the role of integrin signaling in lymphomas and demonstrated that inhibition of integrin-ligand interactions abrogated the proliferation of malignant cells in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft. Here we demonstrate the role of lymph node tissue stiffness on DLBCL in a B-cell molecular subtype specific manner. We engineered tunable bioartificial hydrogels that mimicked the stiffness of healthy and neoplastic lymph nodes of a transgenic mouse model and primary human lymphoma tumors. Our results demonstrate that molecularly diverse DLBCLs grow differentially in soft and high stiffness microenvironments, which further modulates the integrin and B-cell receptor expression level as well as response to therapeutics. We anticipate that our findings will be broadly useful to study lymphoma biology and discover new class of therapeutics that target B-cell tumors in physical environments.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

6827,"Prkar1a gene knockout in the pancreas leads to neuroendocrine tumorigenesis.; PRKAR1A and metastasis and mouse model and neuroendocrine tumors and pancreas; Carney complex (CNC) is a rare disease associated with multiple neoplasias, including a predisposition to pancreatic tumors; it is caused most frequently by the inactivation of the PRKAR1A gene, a regulator of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent kinase (PKA). The method used was to create null alleles of prkar1a in mouse cells expressing pdx1 (-Prkar1a). We found that these mice developed endocrine or mixed endocrine/acinar cell carcinomas with 100% penetrance by the age of 4-5 months. Malignant behavior of the tumors was seen as evidenced by stromal invasion and metastasis to locoregional lymph nodes. Histologically, most tumors exhibited an organoid pattern as seen in the islet-cell tumors. Biochemically, the lesions exhibited high PKA activity, as one would expect from deleting prkar1a The primary neuroendocrine nature of these tumor cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy, the latter revealing the characteristic granules. Although the -Prkar1a mice developed hypoglycemia after overnight fasting, insulin and glucagon levels in the plasma were normal. Negative immunohistochemical staining for the most commonly produced peptides (insulin, c-peptide, glucagon, gastrin and somatostatin) suggested that these tumors were non-functioning. We hypothesize that the recently identified multipotent pdx1+/insulin- cell in adult pancreas, gives rise to endocrine or mixed endocrine/acinar pancreatic malignancies with complete prkar1a deficiency. In conclusion, this mouse model supports the role of prkar1a as a tumor suppressor gene in the pancreas and points to the PKA pathway as a possible therapeutic target for these lesions.",islet,islet,,unidentified

Case Presentation: We report a case of a 41-year-old woman who had complained of a mass in the thyroid gland. Histology revealed tumor cells arranged in a nest-like or organoid pattern, separated by delicate fibrovascular septa. Two distinct components were observed. In the first, which constituted the majority of the tumor cells, no pigments were observed. In the second, a few cells with pigment showed intercellular substance, but the structure was unclear. Using immunohistochemistry, cells in the first component were confirmed to be diffuse strong positive for synaptophysin, but negative for chromogranin A, pan-cytokeratin, calcitonin, and thyroglobulin. About 1% of tumor cells were stained by Ki-67. In the margins of the tumor, a few cells were observed to be positive for HMB-45 and Melan A after bleaching by oxalic acid. The stromal cells were positive for S-100. Using electron microscopy, a few cells containing many round melanin bodies with greater electron density granules of nonuniform size were observed.

We present here an interesting case of HTT which provides the basis for review of this entity's clinical characteristics, criteria useful in making the diagnosis, and any currently available therapeutic modalities. Case presentation: A 70-year-old Caucasian female underwent a CT scan of her chest and was incidentally found to have a nodule within the right thyroid lobe. Gross examination of the excised thyroid lobe revealed a circumscribed and encapsulated lesion (tan / gritty in texture), confined to the gland. Histologic sections of the lesion revealed a circumscribed neoplasm with a trabecular and organoid architecture associated with abundant dystrophic calcification. Neoplastic cells showed a spindled morphology with clumped chromatin and ample eosinophilic cytoplasm. Conclusion(s): Histologically, HTT is a follicular cell-derived tumor composed of neoplastic cells arranged in a trabecular pattern with hyalinization and calcification of extracellular material. Distinguishing features of HTT include minimal cytologic atypia with a low nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio, cellular aggregates around hyalinized material, and nuclei with clumped chromatin and occasional grooves and/or pseudoinclusions.

Tumor cells from either primary tumors, 2-dimensional (2D) cell lines or 3-dimensional (3D) organoids are injected into the cecum and, depending on the metastatic potential of the injected tumor cells, form highly metastatic tumors. In addition, CTCs can be found regularly.

Noting that the use of animal models failed to lead to the design of effective treatments for cancer, OncoTheis has opted to develop in vitro models based exclusively on human cells. The company currently focuses on lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with more than one million deaths per year. To address this public health concern, we developed OncoCilAirTM, a new 3-D model that mimics in vitro the progression of the disease as it happens in patients. In this system, bronchial and lung tumour cells obtained from discarded surgical tissue are cocultured in a Petri dish to reconstitute a fragment of the human lung. After appropriate differentiation, the culture closely reproduces malignant pulmonary nodules invading a small piece of functional airway tissue. As OncoCilAir includes both healthy and cancerous tissues, it can be used to test tumour-killing activity and the adverse effects of chemotherapies and other anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, a single culture can be maintained for up to three months, which permits studies of longer-Term effects, including the assessment of drug resistance and tumour recurrence.

All tumors occurred on the scalp or the face (2 cases lacked clinical information) and presented as a solitary lesion, measuring from 5 to 20 mm. The patients' age ranged from 22 to 89 years. The main component of all tumors was small, uniform basaloid cells (immature sebocytes) intermixed with mature sebocytes clearly arranged in nodules, classifying the lesions as a sebaceoma. In all neoplasms, the tumor cells showed organoid growth patterns of sebaceoma, including rippled, sinusoidal/labyrinthine, and carcinoid-like, occurring alone or in combination. Additionally, numerous infundibulocystic structures were readily noticed and were either distributed multifocally or unilocular within the tumors. In some cases, they were segregated from the main tumor bulk. The authors posit that these structures, which are different from both sebaceous ductal differentiation and squamous metaplasia, represent an authentic follicular differentiation. The infundibulocystic features (combined with squamous metaplasia), when prominent and in a limited biopsy specimen, may cause a confusion with trichoadenoma or even microcystic adnexal carcinoma.  2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",sebaceous gland,sebaceous gland,,unidentified

7364,"Integrin-specific hydrogels as adaptable tumor organoids for malignant B and T cells.; B cell and Hydrogels and Integrins and Lymphoma and Organoids and Panobinostat and T cell; Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders of B and T cell origin that are treated with chemotherapy drugs with variable success rate that has virtually not changed over decades. Although new classes of chemotherapy-free epigenetic and metabolic drugs have emerged, durable responses to these conventional and new therapies are achieved in a fraction of cancer patients, with many individuals experiencing resistance to the drugs. The paucity in our understanding of what regulates the drug resistance phenotype and establishing a predictive indicator is, in great part, due to the lack of adequate ex vivo lymphoma models to accurately study the effect of microenvironmental cues in which malignant B and T cell lymphoma cells arise and reside. Unlike many other tumors, lymphomas have been neglected from biomaterials-based microenvironment engineering standpoint. In this study, we demonstrate that B and T cell lymphomas have different pro-survival integrin signaling requirements (v3 and 41) and the presence of supporting follicular dendritic cells are critical for enhanced proliferation in three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. We engineered adaptable 3D tumor organoids presenting adhesive peptides with distinct integrin specificities to B and T cell lymphoma cells that resulted in enhanced proliferation, clustering, and drug resistance to the chemotherapeutics and a new class of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), Panobinostat. In Diffuse Large B cell Lymphomas, the 3D microenvironment upregulated the expression level of B cell receptor (BCR), which supported the survival of B cell lymphomas through a tyrosine kinase Syk in the upstream BCR pathway. Our integrin specific ligand functionalized 3D organoids mimic a lymphoid neoplasm-like heterogeneous microenvironment that could, in the long term, change the understanding of the initiation and progression of hematological tumors, allow primary biospecimen analysis, provide prognostic values, and importantly, allow a faster and more rational screening and translation of therapeutic regimens.",lymphoid,lymphoid,,ok

Surgical excision is the first-line treatment for functional (hormone-producing) pituitary adenomas, except for prolactin-producing adenomas; however, complete excision is technically challenging, and many patients require long-term medication after the treatment. In addition, the pathophysiology of pituitary adenomas, such as tumorigenesis, has not been fully understood. Pituitary adenoma pathophysiology has mainly been studied using animal models and animal tumor-derived cell lines. Nevertheless, experimental studies on human pituitary adenomas are difficult because of the significant differences among species and the lack of reliable cell lines. Recently, several methods have been established to differentiate pituitary cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The induced pituitary hormone-producing cells retain the physiological properties already lost in tumor-derived cell lines. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9 systems have expedited the introduction of causative gene mutations in various malignant tumors into hPSCs. Therefore, hPSC-derived pituitary cells have great potential as a novel platform for studying the pathophysiology of human-specific pituitary adenomas and developing novel drugs.

Preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate the genomic and histopathological features of cancer are critical for the development of new treatments. The most commonly used models of MPM are two-dimensional cell lines established from primary tumours or pleural fluid. While these have provided some important insights into MPM biology, these cell models have significant limitations. In order to address some of these limitations, spheroids and microfluidic chips have more recently been used to investigate the role of the three-dimensional environment in MPM. Efforts have also been made to develop animal models of MPM, including asbestos-induced murine tumour models, MPM-prone genetically modified mice and patient-derived xenografts. Here, we discuss the available in vitro and in vivo models of MPM and highlight their strengths and limitations. We discuss how newer technologies, such as the tumour-derived organoids, might allow us to address the limitations of existing models and aid in the identification of effective treatments for this challenging-to-treat disease.",pleura,pleura,,ok
9103,"The Biology of Malignant Mesothelioma and the Relevance of Preclinical Models; NA; Malignant mesothelioma (MM), especially its more frequent form, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), is a devastating thoracic cancer with limited therapeutic options. Recently, clinical trials that used immunotherapy strategies have yielded promising results, but the benefits are restricted to a limited number of patients. To develop new therapeutic strategies and define predictors of treatment response to existing therapy, better knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of MM tumors and sound preclinical models are needed. This review aims to provide an overview of our present knowledge and issues on both subjects. MM shows a complex pattern of molecular changes, including genetic, chromosomic, and epigenetic alterations. MM is also a heterogeneous cancer. The recently described molecular classifications for MPM could better consider inter-tumor heterogeneity, while histo-molecular gradients are an interesting way to consider both intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneities. Classical preclinical models are based on use of MM cell lines in culture or implanted in rodents, i.e., xenografts in immunosuppressed mice or isografts in syngeneic rodents to assess the anti-tumor immune response. Recent developments are tumoroids, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), xenografts in humanized mice, and genetically modified mice (GEM) that carry mutations identified in human MM tumor cells. Multicellular tumor spheroids are an interesting in vitro model to reduce animal experimentation; they are more accessible than tumoroids. They could be relevant, especially if they are co-cultured with stromal and immune cells to partially reproduce the human microenvironment. Even if preclinical models have allowed for major advances, they show several limitations: (i) the anatomical and biological tumor microenvironments are incompletely reproduced; (ii) the intra-tumor heterogeneity and immunological contexts are not fully reconstructed; and (iii) the inter-tumor heterogeneity is insufficiently considered. Given that these limitations vary according to the models, preclinical models must be carefully selected depending on the objectives of the experiments. New approaches, such as organ-on-a-chip technologies or in silico biological systems, should be explored in MM research. More pertinent cell models, based on our knowledge on mesothelial carcinogenesis and considering MM heterogeneity, need to be developed. These endeavors are mandatory to implement efficient precision medicine for MM. ",pleura,pleura,,ok
9323,"Unraveling Heterogeneity in Epithelial Cell Fates of the Mammary Gland and Breast Cancer.; 3D cultures and breast cancer and cell fate and heterogeneity and mammary gland and organoids and signaling and single-cell RNAseq; Fluidity in cell fate or heterogeneity in cell identity is an interesting cell biological phenomenon, which at the same time poses a significant obstacle for cancer therapy. The mammary gland seems a relatively straightforward organ with stromal cells and basal- and luminal- epithelial cell types. In reality, the epithelial cell fates are much more complex and heterogeneous, which is the topic of this review. Part of the complexity comes from the dynamic nature of this organ: the primitive epithelial tree undergoes extensively remodeling and expansion during puberty, pregnancy, and lactation and, unlike most other organs, the bulk of mammary gland development occurs late, during puberty. An active cell biological debate has focused on lineage commitment to basal- and luminal- epithelial cell fates by epithelial progenitor and stem cells; processes that are also relevant to cancer biology. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of heterogeneity in mammary gland and recent insights obtained through lineage tracing, signaling assays, and organoid cultures. Lastly, we relate these insights to cancer and ongoing efforts to resolve heterogeneity in breast cancer with single-cell RNAseq approaches.",mammary gland,mammary gland,,mammary
9600,"Emerging Opportunities for Target Discovery in Rare Cancers.; CRISPR/Cas9 and chordoma and conditionally reprogrammed cells and genomics and next-generation sequencing and organoid and patient-derived xenograft and rare cancer and small-molecule screen and target discovery; Rare cancers pose unique challenges to research due to their low incidence. Barriers include a scarcity of tissue and experimental models to enable basic research and insufficient patient accrual for clinical studies. Consequently, an understanding of the genetic and cellular features of many rare cancer types and their associated vulnerabilities has been lacking. However, new opportunities are emerging to facilitate discovery of therapeutic targets in rare cancers. Online platforms are allowing patients with rare cancers to organize on an unprecedented scale, tumor genome sequencing is now routinely performed in research and clinical settings, and the efficiency of patient-derived model generation has improved. New CRISPR/Cas9 and small-molecule libraries permit cancer dependency discovery in a rapid and systematic fashion. In parallel, large-scale studies of common cancers now provide reference datasets to help interpret rare cancer profiling data. Together, these advances motivate consideration of new research frameworks to accelerate rare cancer target discovery.",spine,spine,,ok

10283,"Unraveled roles of Cav1.2 in proliferation and stemness of ameloblastoma.; Ameloblastoma and Calcium signaling and Cav1.2 and Proliferation and Stemness; BACKGROUND: Transcriptome analysis has been known as a functional tool for cancer research recently. Mounting evidence indicated that calcium signaling plays several key roles in cancer progression. Despite numerous studies examining calcium signaling in cancer, calcium signaling studies in ameloblastoma are limited. RESULTS: In the present study, comparative transcriptome profiling of two representative odontogenic lesions, ameloblastoma and odontogenic keratocyst, revealed that Cav1.2 (CACNA1C, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) is strongly enriched in ameloblastoma. It was confirmed that the Ca(2+) influx in ameloblastoma cells is mainly mediated by Cav1.2 through L-type voltage-gated calcium channel agonist and blocking reagent treatment. Overexpression and knockdown of Cav1.2 showed that Cav1.2 is directly involved in the regulation of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 (NFATc1), which causes cell proliferation. Furthermore, a tumoroid study indicated that Cav1.2-dependent Ca(2+) entry is also associated with the maintenance of stemness of ameloblastoma cells via the enhancement of Wnt/-catenin signaling activity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Cav1.2 regulates the NFATc1 nuclear translocation to enhance ameloblastoma cell proliferation. Furthermore, Cav1.2 dependent Ca(2+) influx contributes to the Wnt/-catenin activity for the ameloblastoma cell stemness and tumorigenicity. Our fundamental findings could have a major impact in the fields of oral maxillofacial surgery, and genetic manipulation or pharmacological approaches to Cav1.2 can be considered as new therapeutic options.",tooth,tooth,,ok
10506,"A Cancer-Selective Zinc Ionophore Inspired by the Natural Product Naamidine A.; NA; We present data demonstrating the natural product mimic, zinaamidole A (ZNA), is a modulator of metal ion homeostasis causing cancer-selective cell death by specifically inducing cellular Zn(2+)-uptake in transformed cells. ZNA's cancer selectivity was evaluated using metastatic, patient-derived breast cancer cells, established human breast cancer cell lines, and three-dimensional organoid models derived from normal and transformed mouse mammary glands. Structural analysis of ZNA demonstrated that the compound interacts with zinc through the N(2)-acyl-2-aminoimidazole core. Combination treatment with ZnSO(4) strongly potentiated ZNA's cancer-specific cell death mechanism, an effect that was not observed with other transition metals. We show that Zn(2+)-dyshomeostasis induced by ZNA is unique and markedly more selective than other known Zn(2+)-interacting compounds such as clioquinol. The in vivo bioactivity of ZNA was also assessed and revealed that tumor-bearing mice treated with ZNA had improved survival outcomes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the N(2)-acyl-2-aminoimidazole core of ZNA represents a powerful chemotype to induce cell death in cancer cells concurrently with a disruption in zinc homeostasis.",mammary,mammary gland,,ok

Incremental hypoxia inside the growing tumor mass drives epigenetic drug resistance by activating nongenetic repair of antiapoptotic DNA, which could be impaired by drug treatment. Hence, rescuing intertumor hypoxia by oxygen-generating microparticles may promote susceptibility to antitumor drugs. Moreover, a tumor-on-a-chip model enables user-specified alternation of clinic-derived samples. This study utilizes patient-derived glioblastoma tissue to generate cell spheroids with size variations in a 3D microchannel network chip (GBM chip). As the spheroid size increases, epigenetic drug resistance is promoted with inward hypoxia severance, as supported by the spheroid size-proportional expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in the chip. Loading antihypoxia microparticles onto the spheroid surface significantly reduces drug resistance by silencing the expression of critical epigenetic factor, resulting in significantly decreased cell invasiveness.

Glioblastoma, the most common primary tumor in adults, is associated with poor survival and remains one of the least treatable neoplasms. These tumors are highly heterogenous and complex in their nature. Due to this complexity, traditional cell culturing techniques and methods do not provide an ideal recapitulating model for the study of these tumors' behavior in vivo. Two-dimensional models lack the spatial arrangement, the heterogeneity in cell types, and the microenvironment that play a large role in tumor cell behavior and response to treatment.

Although several in vitro models have been developed to study hypoxia-related cancer pathology, the complex interplay of the cancer microenvironment observed in vivo has not been reproduced yet owing to the lack of precise spatial control. Instead, 3D biofabrication approaches have been proposed to create microphysiological systems for better emulation of cancer ecology and accurate anticancer treatment evaluation. Herein, we propose a 3D cell-printing approach to fabricate a hypoxic cancer-on-a-chip. The hypoxia-inducing components in the chip were determined based on a computer simulation of the oxygen distribution. Cancer-stroma concentric rings were printed using bioinks containing glioblastoma cells and endothelial cells to recapitulate a type of solid cancer. The resulting chip realized central hypoxia and aggravated malignancy in cancer with the formation of representative pathophysiological markers. Overall, the proposed approach for creating a solid-cancer-mimetic microphysiological system is expected to bridge the gap between in vivo and in vitro models for cancer research.",neural,neural,,ok

Hence, more optimized treatment strategy is urgently needed in diffuse-type GC. METHODS: Using a panel of 10 GC cell lines and 3 GC patient-derived cells (PDCs), we identified cell lines with high EMTness which is a distinct feature for diffuse-type GC. We treated GC cells with high EMTness with ramucirumab alone, TGF- receptor kinase inhibitor (TEW-7197) alone, or in combination to investigate the drug's effects on invasiveness, spheroid formation, EMT marker expression, and tumor-induced angiogenesis using a spheroid-on-a-chip model. RESULTS: Both TEW-7197 and ramucirumab treatments profoundly decreased invasiveness of EMT-high cell lines and PDCs. With a 3D tumor spheroid-on-a-chip, we identified versatile influence of co-treatment on cancer cell-induced blood vessel formation as well as on EMT progression in tumor spheroids. The 3D tumor spheroid-on-a-chip demonstrated that TEW-7197 + ramucirumab combination significantly decreased PDC-induced vessel formation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed TEW-7197 and ramucirumab considerably decreased invasiveness, thus EMTness in a panel of diffuse-type GC cell lines including GC PDCs.

13085,"3D collagen vascular tumor-on-a-chip mimetics for dynamic combinatorial drug screening; NA; Disease models, including in vitro cell culture and animal models, have contributed significantly to developing diagnostics and treatments over the past several decades. The successes of traditional drug screening methods were generally hampered by not adequately mimicking critical in vivo features, such as a 3D microenvironment and dynamic drug diffusion through the extracellular matrix (ECM). To address these issues, we developed a 3D dynamic drug delivery system for cancer drug screening that mimicks drug dissemination through the tumor vasculature and the ECM by creating collagen-embedded microfluidic channels. Using this novel 3D ECM microsystem, we compared viability of tumor pieces with traditionally used 2D methods in response to three different drug combinations. Drug diffusion profiles were evaluated by simulation methods and tested in the 3D ECM microsystem and a 2D 96-well setup. Compared with the 2D control, the 3D ECM microsystem produced reliable data on viability, drug ratios, and combination indeces. This novel approach enables higher throughput and sets the stage for future applications utilizing drug sensitivity predicting algorithms based on dynamic diffusion profiles requiring only minimal patient tissue. Our findings moved drug sensitivity screening closer to clinical implications with a focus on testing combinatorial drug effects, an option often limited by the amount of available patient tissues.",vascular,vascular,,ok
13262,"Human in vitro vascularized micro-organ and micro-tumor models are reproducible organ-on-a-chip platforms for studies of anticancer drugs.; Drug safety evaluation and Endothelial cell and Microphysiological system and Tissue chip; Angiogenesis is a complex process that is required for development and tissue regeneration and it may be affected by many pathological conditions. Chemicals and drugs can impact formation and maintenance of the vascular networks; these effects may be both desirable (e.g., anti-cancer drugs) or unwanted (e.g., side effects of drugs). A number of in vivo and in vitro models exist for studies of angiogenesis and endothelial cell function, including organ-on-a-chip microphysiological systems. An arrayed organ-on-a-chip platform on a 96-well plate footprint that incorporates perfused microvessels, with and without tumors, was recently developed and it was shown that survival of the surrounding tissue was dependent on delivery of nutrients through the vessels. Here we describe a technology transfer of this complex microphysiological model between laboratories and demonstrate that reproducibility and robustness of these tissue chip-enabled experiments depend primarily on the source of the endothelial cells. The model was highly reproducible between laboratories and was used to demonstrate the advantages of the perfusable vascular networks for drug safety evaluation. As a proof-of-concept, we tested Fluorouracil (1-1,000 M), Vincristine (1-1,000 nM), and Sorafenib (0.1-100 M), in the perfusable and non-perfusable micro-organs, and in a colon cancer-containing micro-tumor model. Tissue chip experiments were compared to the traditional monolayer cultures of endothelial or tumor cells. These studies showed that human in vitro vascularized micro-organ and micro-tumor models are reproducible organ-on-a-chip platforms for studies of anticancer drugs. The data from the 3D models confirmed advantages of the physiological environment as compared to 2D cell cultures.

The iPS-derived cells include a GCaMP6 fluorescence reporter to allow real-time imaging to monitor intracellular calcium transients. The multiple-chambered tissue chip features electrodes for pacing of the cardiac tissue to assess cardiomyocyte function such as the maximum capture rate and conduction velocity. We measured the inhibition concentration (IC50) of the anticancer drugs, Doxorubicin (0.1 M) and Oxaliplatin (4.2 M), on the tissue chip loaded with colon cancer cells (SW620). We simultaneously evaluated the cardiotoxicity of these anticancer drugs by assessing the drug effect on the spontaneous beat frequency and conduction velocity of iPS-derived cardiac tissue. Consistent with in vivo observations, Doxorubicin reduced the spontaneous beating rate and maximum capture rate at or near the IC50 (0.04 and 0.22 M, respectively), whereas the toxicity of Oxaliplatin was only observed at concentrations beyond the IC50 (33 and 9.9 M, respectively).

13362,"A biomimetic pancreatic cancer on-chip reveals endothelial ablation via ALK7 signaling.; NA; Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive, lethal malignancy that invades adjacent vasculatures and spreads to distant sites before clinical detection. Although invasion into the peripancreatic vasculature is one of the hallmarks of PDAC, paradoxically, PDAC tumors also exhibit hypovascularity. How PDAC tumors become hypovascular is poorly understood. We describe an organotypic PDAC-on-a-chip culture model that emulates vascular invasion and tumor-blood vessel interactions to better understand PDAC-vascular interactions. The model features a 3D matrix containing juxtaposed PDAC and perfusable endothelial lumens. PDAC cells invaded through intervening matrix, into vessel lumen, and ablated the endothelial cells, leaving behind tumor-filled luminal structures. Endothelial ablation was also observed in in vivo PDAC models. We also identified the activin-ALK7 pathway as a mediator of endothelial ablation by PDAC. This tumor-on-a-chip model provides an important in vitro platform for investigating the process of PDAC-driven endothelial ablation and may provide a mechanism for tumor hypovascularity.",pancreatic duct,pancreas,,ok

Efficient cures are still absent, despite all attempts to understand the aggressive physiopathology underlying this disease. A major stumbling block is the outdated preclinical modeling strategies applied in assessing effectiveness of novel anticancer therapeutics. Current in vitro preclinical models have a low fidelity to mimic the exact architectural and functional complexity of PDAC tumor found in human set, due to the lack of major components such as immune system and tumor microenvironment with its associated chemical and mechanical signals. The existing PDAC preclinical platforms are still far from being reliable and trustworthy to guarantee the success of a drug in clinical trials.

14332,"The Biology of Malignant Mesothelioma and the Relevance of Preclinical Models; NA; Malignant mesothelioma (MM), especially its more frequent form, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), is a devastating thoracic cancer with limited therapeutic options. Recently, clinical trials that used immunotherapy strategies have yielded promising results, but the benefits are restricted to a limited number of patients. To develop new therapeutic strategies and define predictors of treatment response to existing therapy, better knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of MM tumors and sound preclinical models are needed. This review aims to provide an overview of our present knowledge and issues on both subjects. MM shows a complex pattern of molecular changes, including genetic, chromosomic, and epigenetic alterations. MM is also a heterogeneous cancer. The recently described molecular classifications for MPM could better consider inter-tumor heterogeneity, while histo-molecular gradients are an interesting way to consider both intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneities. Classical preclinical models are based on use of MM cell lines in culture or implanted in rodents, i.e., xenografts in immunosuppressed mice or isografts in syngeneic rodents to assess the anti-tumor immune response. Recent developments are tumoroids, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), xenografts in humanized mice, and genetically modified mice (GEM) that carry mutations identified in human MM tumor cells. Multicellular tumor spheroids are an interesting in vitro model to reduce animal experimentation; they are more accessible than tumoroids. They could be relevant, especially if they are co-cultured with stromal and immune cells to partially reproduce the human microenvironment. Even if preclinical models have allowed for major advances, they show several limitations: (i) the anatomical and biological tumor microenvironments are incompletely reproduced; (ii) the intra-tumor heterogeneity and immunological contexts are not fully reconstructed; and (iii) the inter-tumor heterogeneity is insufficiently considered. Given that these limitations vary according to the models, preclinical models must be carefully selected depending on the objectives of the experiments. New approaches, such as organ-on-a-chip technologies or in silico biological systems, should be explored in MM research. More pertinent cell models, based on our knowledge on mesothelial carcinogenesis and considering MM heterogeneity, need to be developed.

While conventional in vitro cell cultures under-represent the complexity and dynamic crosstalk of the tumor microenvironment, animal models do not allow deciphering the anti-tumor activity of the human immune system. Therefore, the development of reliable and predictive preclinical models has become crucial for the screening of immune-therapeutic approaches. We here present an organ-on-chip organ on chips (OOC)-based approach for recapitulating the immune cell Natural Killer (NK) migration under physiological fluid flow, infiltration within a 3D tumor matrix, and activation against neuroblastoma cancer cells in a humanized, fluid-dynamic environment. Circulating NK cells actively initiate a spontaneous ""extravasation"" process toward the physically separated tumor niche, retaining their ability to interact with matrix-embedded tumor cells, and to display a cytotoxic effect (tumor cell apoptosis). Since NK cells infiltration and phenotype is correlated with prognosis and response to immunotherapy, their phenotype is also investigated: most importantly, a clear decrease in CD16-positive NK cells within the migrated and infiltrated population is observed.

These findings demonstrate the importance of studying the dynamic synergistic relationship between patient cells with stromal fibroblasts, in a 3D perfused vascular network, to accurately understand and recapitulate the tumor microenvironment.",pancreas,pancreas,,ok
14959,"Patient-derived pancreatic cancer-on-a-chip recapitulates the tumor microenvironment.; Engineering and Materials science; The patient population suffering from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents, as a whole, with a high degree of molecular tumor heterogeneity. The heterogeneity of PDAC tumor composition has complicated treatment and stalled success in clinical trials. Current in vitro techniques insufficiently replicate the intricate stromal components of PDAC tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and fail to model a given tumor's unique genetic phenotype. The development of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) has opened the door for improved personalized medicine since PDOs are derived directly from patient tumors, thus preserving the tumors' unique behaviors and genetic phenotypes. This study developed a tumor-chip device engineered to mimic the PDAC TME by incorporating PDOs and stromal cells, specifically pancreatic stellate cells and macrophages. Establishing PDOs in a multicellular microfluidic chip device prolongs cellular function and longevity and successfully establishes a complex organotypic tumor environment that incorporates desmoplastic stroma and immune cells. When primary cancer cells in monoculture were subjected to stroma-depleting agents, there was no effect on cancer cell viability. However, targeting stroma in our tumor-chip model resulted in a significant increase in the chemotherapy effect on cancer cells, thus validating the use of this tumor-chip device for drug testing.",pancreatic duct,pancreas,,ok

Whereas, recent oncoimmunological approaches have focused its role in immune surveillance. In response to the emerging topics of lymphatic vascular biology, physiologically relevant human cell-based in vitro model is in high demand. This study introduces a 3D in vitro model of human LV within tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using an injection-molded plastic array culture platform (Lymph-IMPACT). Through spontaneous capillary flow-driven patterning of 3D cellular hydrogel and optimized cellular composition, the platform enables robust and reproducible formation of self-organized LV in vitro. This co-culture model recapitulates cancer cell type-dependent morphogenesis of LV in vitro. Moreover, the robustness of the model enables high-content analysis on the effect of anti-VEGFR3 drug depending on the existence of blood vessels or different types of cancer cells. By virtue of high perfusability of 3D lumenized in vitro LV, a trans-endothelial migration of cytotoxic primary lymphocytes, which is one of the critical processes in anti-tumor immunology, is recapitulated within reconstructed melanoma TIME.

Besides being typically disposable, these devices should ideally be compatible with a mass-production scale and have relatively low costs, while maintaining their biocompatibility. In this context, Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a very advantageous technology to produce inserts for the Injection Molding (IM) of thermoplastic devices. We here present a cancer-on-a-chip platform mimicking Neuroblastoma (NB) progression. NB, an embryonal malignancy of early childhood, has a grim prognosis also determined by its high tendency to form metastases.

Thus, the development of a model for effective drug screening is urgently needed. As the established therapeutic testing models for CCA are often ineffective, we fabricated an enabling three-dimensional (3D)-bioprinted CCA-on-a-chip model that to a good extent resembled the multicellular microenvironment and the anatomical microstructure of the hepato-vascular-biliary system to perform high-content antitumor drug screening. Specifically, cholangiocytes, hepatocytes, and vascular endotheliocytes were employed for 3D bioprinting of the models, allowing for a high degree of spatial and tube-like microstructural control. Interestingly, it was possible to observe CCA cells attached to the surfaces of the gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel-embedded microchannels and overgrown in a thickening manner, generating bile duct stenosis, which was expected to be analogous to the in vivo configuration. Over 4000 differentially expressed genes were detected in the CCA cells in our 3D coculture model compared to the traditional two-dimensional (2D) monoculture. Further screening revealed that the CCA cells grown in the 3D traditional model were more sensitive to the antitumoral prodrug than those in the 2D monoculture due to drug biotransformation by the neighboring functional hepatocytes. This study provides proof-of-concept validation of our bioprinted CCA-on-a-chip as a promising drug screening model for CCA treatment and paves the way for potential personalized medicine strategies for CCA patients in the future.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising candidates due to their unique tropism toward cancer cells, yet the tumor-tropic abilities can differ for MSCs sourced from different tissues. Here, a multichannel microfluidic chip to screen different sourced MSCs with the greatest tropism toward cervical cancer cells is developed. Based on this, the cell membranes from the chorionic plate-derived MSC are isolated and membrane-camouflaged platinum prodrug composite NPs for cervical cancer treatment are prepared. Results demonstrate that the composite NPs can effectively target tumor sites and have a therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

To this end, 3D melanoma spheroids were monocultured and co-cultured with human dermal fibroblasts and the NK-92 cell migration towards the tumor compartment was tested in a commercially available microfluidic device.

Due to few patients and experimental models, there have not been enough studies to demonstrate the pathogenesis of the disease and novel effective treatment for cMM. Since cMM resembles human MM (hMM) in histopathological characteristics, it is also considered a promising research model of hMM. Compared with conventional 2-dimensional (2D) culture methods, 3-dimensional (3D) organoid culture can recapitulate the properties of original tumor tissues. However, cMM organoids have never been developed. In the present study, we for the first time generated cMM organoids using the pleural effusion samples. Organoids from individual MM dogs were successfully generated. They exhibited the characteristics of MM and expressed mesothelial cell markers, such as WT-1 and mesothelin. The sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs was different in each strain of cMM organoids. RNA sequencing analysis showed cell adhesion molecule pathways were specifically upregulated in cMM organoids compared with their corresponding 2D cultured cells. Among these genes, the expression level of E-cadherin was drastically higher in the organoids than that in the 2D cells.

In the literature, there is no effective therapy strategy for patients with NICH except surgery. Currently, no cell line or animal model exists for studying the mechanism of NICH and drug validation.

Both HE and immunohistological staining exactly matched NICH tissue. We further performed transcriptome analysis to elucidate the characteristics of NICH organoids. Both NICH tissue and NICH organoids manifested similar trends in download sites. NICH organoids display novel features to new cells derived from organoids and show spectacular multiplication capacity. In the preliminary verification, we found that cells splitting from NICH organoids were human endothelial cells. Drug validation demonstrated that trametinib, sirolimus, and propranolol showed no inhibitory effects on NICH organoids.

17837,"Sunitinib efficacy with minimal toxicity in patient-derived retinoblastoma organoids.; Drug screening and Organoid and Retinal toxicity and Retinoblastoma and Sunitinib; BACKGROUND: Recurrence of retinoblastoma (RB) following chemoreduction is common and is often managed with local (intra-arterial/intravitreal) chemotherapy. However, some tumors are resistant to even local administration of maximum feasible drug dosages, or effective tumor control and globe preservation may be achieved at the cost of vision loss due to drug-induced retinal toxicity. The aim of this study was to identify drugs with improved antitumor activity and more favorable retinal toxicity profiles via screening of potentially repurposable FDA-approved drugs in patient-derived tumor organoids. METHODS: Genomic profiling of five RB organoids and the corresponding parental tissues was performed. RB organoids were screened with 133 FDA-approved drugs, and candidate drugs were selected based on cytotoxicity and potency. RNA sequencing was conducted to generate a drug signature from RB organoids, and the effects of drugs on cell cycle progression and proliferative tumor cone restriction were examined. Drug toxicity was assessed with human embryonic stem cell-derived normal retinal organoids. The efficacy/toxicity profiles of candidate drugs were compared with those of drugs in clinical use. RESULTS: RB organoids maintained the genomic features of the parental tumors. Sunitinib was identified as highly cytotoxic against both classical RB1-deficient and novel MYCN-amplified RB organoids and inhibited proliferation while inducing differentiation in RB. Sunitinib was a more effective suppressor of proliferative tumor cones in RB organoids and had lower toxicity in normal retinal organoids than either melphalan or topotecan.

Surgery remains the only curative treatment for localized disease. For patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic disease, few targeted therapies are available, but their efficacy is unpredictable and variable. Exploiting prior knowledge on pathogenetic processes involved in PanNEN tumorigenesis, we tested buparlisib (PI3K inhibitor) and ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor), as single agents or in combination, in different preclinical models. First, we used cell lines representative of well-differentiated (INS-1E, NT-3) and poorly differentiated (BON-1) PanNENs. The combination of buparlisib with ribociclib reduced the proliferation of 2D and 3D spheroid cultures more potently than the individual drugs. Buparlisib, but not ribociclib, induced apoptosis. The anti-proliferative activity of the drugs correlated with downstream target inhibition at mRNA and protein levels. We then tested the drugs on primary islet microtissues from a genetic PanNET animal model (Men1-defective mice) and from wild-type mice: the drug combination was effective against the former without altering islet cell physiology. Finally, we treated PanNET patient-derived islet-like 3D tumoroids: the combination of buparlisib with ribociclib was effective in three out of four samples.

Here, we report of the first long-term culture of a G2 metastatic small intestinal NET that preserves the main genetic drivers of the tumor and retains expression patterns of the endocrine cell lineage. Replicating the tissue, this long-term culture showed a low proliferation index, and yet it could be propagated continuously without dramatic changes in the karyotype. The model was readily available for pharmacological screens using targeted agents and as expected, showed low tumorigenic capacity in vivo. Overall, this is the first long-term culture of NETs to faithfully recapitulate many aspects of the original neuroendocrine tumor.",small intestine,small intestine,,ok
18361,"Reconstruct Human Retinoblastoma In Vitro.; NA; Human RB is pediatric cancer, which is lethal if no treatment is administered. As RB originates from cone precursors, which is relatively rare in rodent models, meanwhile regarding the interspecies differences between humans and rodents, a disease model derived from humans is more beneficial for uncovering the mechanisms of human RB and seeking the targets of therapy. Herein, the protocol describes the generation of two gene-edited hESC lines with a biallelic RB1 point mutation (RB1(Mut/Mut)) and an RB1 knockout mutation (RB1(-/-)), respectively. During the process of retinal development, the formation of RB is observed. The RB cell lines are also established by segregating from the RB organoids. Altogether, by differentiating the gene-edited hESC lines into the retinal organoids using a 2D and 3D combined differentiation protocol, we have successfully reconstructed the human RB in a dish and identified its cone-precursor origin. It would provide a helpful disease model for observing the retinoblastoma genesis, proliferation, and growth as well as further developing novel therapeutic agents.",retina,retina,,ok
18379,"Modeling resistance of colorectal peritoneal metastases to immune checkpoint blockade in humanized mice.; B-lymphocytes and CTLA-4 antigen and immunotherapy and programmed cell death 1 receptor and tumor microenvironment; BACKGROUND: The immunogenic nature of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) underlies their responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). However, resistance to ICB is commonly observed, and is associated with the presence of peritoneal-metastases and ascites formation. The mechanisms underlying this site-specific benefit of ICB are unknown. METHODS: We created a novel model for spontaneous multiorgan metastasis in MSI-H CRC tumors by transplanting patient-derived organoids (PDO) into the cecum of humanized mice. Anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocytes-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) ICB treatment effects were analyzed in relation to the immune context of primary tumors, liver metastases, and peritoneal metastases. Immune profiling was performed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. The role of B cells was assessed by antibody-mediated depletion. Immunosuppressive cytokine levels (interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)b1, TGFb2, TGFb3) were determined in ascites and serum samples by ELISA. RESULTS: PDO-initiated primary tumors spontaneously metastasized to the liver and the peritoneum. Peritoneal-metastasis formation was accompanied by the accumulation of ascites. ICB completely cleared liver metastases and reduced primary tumor mass but had no effect on peritoneal metastases. This mimics clinical observations. After therapy discontinuation, primary tumor masses progressively decreased, but peritoneal metastases displayed unabated growth. Therapy efficacy correlated with the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS)-containing B cells and juxtaposed T cells-and with expression of an interferon- signature together with the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13. B cell depletion prevented liver-metastasis clearance by anti-CTLA-4 treatment. Peritoneal metastases were devoid of B cells and TLS, while the T cells in these lesions displayed a dysfunctional phenotype. Ascites samples from patients with cancer with peritoneal metastases and from the mouse model contained significantly higher levels of IL-10, TGFb1, TGFb2 and TGFb3 than serum samples. CONCLUSIONS: By combining organoid and humanized mouse technologies, we present a novel model for spontaneous multiorgan metastasis by MSI-H CRC, in which the clinically observed organ site-dependent benefit of ICB is recapitulated. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence for a critical role for B cells in the generation of site-dependent antitumor immunity following anti-CTLA-4 treatment. High levels of immunosuppressive cytokines in ascites may underlie the observed resistance of peritoneal metastases to ICB.",large intestine,caecum,,large intestine
18546,"Combinatorial treatment rescues tumour-microenvironment-mediated attenuation of MALT1 inhibitors in B-cell lymphomas.; NA; Activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCLs) are characterized by constitutive activation of nuclear factor B driven by the B-cell receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. However, BCR-pathway-targeted therapies have limited impact on DLBCLs. Here we used >1,100 DLBCL patient samples to determine immune and extracellular matrix cues in the lymphoid tumour microenvironment (Ly-TME) and built representative synthetic-hydrogel-based B-cell-lymphoma organoids accordingly. We demonstrate that Ly-TME cellular and biophysical factors amplify the BCR-MYD88-TLR9 multiprotein supercomplex and induce cooperative signalling pathways in ABC-DLBCL cells, which reduce the efficacy of compounds targeting the BCR pathway members Bruton tyrosine kinase and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1). Combinatorial inhibition of multiple aberrant signalling pathways induced higher antitumour efficacy in lymphoid organoids and implanted ABC-DLBCL patient tumours in vivo. Our studies define the complex crosstalk between malignant ABC-DLBCL cells and Ly-TME, and provide rational combinatorial therapies that rescue Ly-TME-mediated attenuation of treatment response to MALT1 inhibitors.",lymphoid,lymphoid,,ok
18878,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells promote regulatory T cell development and suppressive activity via CD70-CD27 interaction.; NA; Despite the intense CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy shows an unsatisfactory response rate in clinical trials, hindered by immunosuppressive signals. To understand how microenvironmental characteristics alter immune homeostasis and limit immunotherapy efficacy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, here we establish a multi-center single-cell cohort based on public data, containing 357,206 cells from 50 patient samples. We reveal that nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells enhance development and suppressive activity of regulatory T cells via CD70-CD27 interaction. CD70 blocking reverts Treg-mediated suppression and thus reinvigorate CD8+ T-cell immunity. Anti-CD70+ anti-PD-1 therapy is evaluated in xenograft-derived organoids and humanized mice, exhibiting an improved tumor-killing efficacy. Mechanistically, CD70 knockout inhibits a collective lipid signaling network in CD4+ nave and regulatory T cells involving mitochondrial integrity, cholesterol homeostasis, and fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, ATAC-Seq delineates that CD70 is transcriptionally upregulated by NFKB2 via an Epstein-Barr virus-dependent epigenetic modification. Our findings identify CD70+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells as a metabolic switch that enforces the lipid-driven development, functional specialization and homeostasis of Tregs, leading to immune evasion. This study also demonstrates that CD70 blockade can act synergistically with anti-PD-1 treatment to reinvigorate T-cell immunity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",nasopharynx,nasopharynx,,ok

Of the small number of drugs are used to treat retinoblastoma, all have been repurposed from drugs developed for other conditions. In order to find drugs or drug combinations better suited to the improved treatment of retinoblastoma, reliable predictive models are required, which facilitate the challenging transition from in vitro studies to clinical trials. In this review, the research performed to date on the development of 2D and 3D in vitro models for retinoblastoma is presented. Most of this research was undertaken with a view to better biological understanding of retinoblastoma, and we discuss the potential for these models to be applied to drug screening.
