# Summary

This folder contains R data files that are generated through R scripts.

Note that each R scripts file typically generates two R data files, ending with either "_F" or "_P". Files with "_F" include text fields and bibliometric fields such as abstracts and journal names of publications, whereas files with "_P" lack them. As we are not allowed to publish all metadata, we are only publishing files ending with "_P" in the repository.
